Starting and building a business – seen through the example of an online marketplace. At the very beginning of my journey, on my first day at work in The Netherlands, a colleague took me in, showed me my desk and my computer. The computer was running Windows. In Dutch. At the interview, they’d been all about the English. Nobody mentioned that anymore. A while after, the boss walked in and called me into his office. He told me – you’re fired. This book is a collection of personal stories – experiences from the life of an entrepreneur. Stories about emigrating and job insecurity; stories of how an entrepreneur was born and how the idea to invest in Serbia came about, how KupujemProdajem started and how it grew; about the struggles business brings with it and the problems along the way (the bears) that have brought insight and turned an entrepreneur into a manager and business leader.');

As with his other books, Martin''s Clean Agile: Back to Basics doesn''t merely present multiple choices and options, and say "use your best judgment": it tells you what choices to make, and why those choices are critical to your success. Writing in the agile context, Martin offers direct, no-nonsense answers to crucial questions like: How and why did Agile begin? What are the costs and benefits of Agile? What are the most effective practices of Agile Development? How should an Agile team be organized? What roles do programmers, testers, and managers play in an Agile team? What is the role of the Agile Coach? What about Agile for large projects? What kinds of projects benefit from Agile?
