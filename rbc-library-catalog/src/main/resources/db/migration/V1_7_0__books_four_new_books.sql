This book helps you fill the very large space in between: aligning technology change with organizational transformation, making architectural decisions, and communicating trade-offs to diverse stakeholders. The book balances structured decision models with real-life anecdotes, both harvested from half a decade of defining and implementing cloud strategies for major organizations.Today''s enterprises need a more nuanced strategy than simply proclaiming "cloud first!" A strategy isn''t something you can copy-paste from a recipe book or from another organization, though: diverse starting points, objectives, and constraints imply different choices and trade-offs. So, rather than offering “proven-3-step-recipes” or touting shallow success stories, this book helps you chart your own strategy by helping you ask the right questions and connecting the dots between the many facets of cloud computing. Your journey will cover why cloud lives in the first derivative, why it’s not just about infrastructure, how to organize for successful cloud migrations, understanding hybrid and multi-cloud architectures without vendor jargon, designing cloud-native applications, and optimizing for cost-efficient and resilient operations.');
